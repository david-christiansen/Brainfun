* A Brainf**k interpreter in Idris

To compile, write:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
 idris --build brainfun.ipkg
#+END_SRC

The resulting executable will be called =brainfun= (or =brainfun.exe=
on Windows).

With no arguments, the program is read on one line from standard
input. With one argument, the argument is the source file.

** TODO
 - Uniqueness types for the state to reduce allocations
 - Convince =go= to pass the coverage checker
